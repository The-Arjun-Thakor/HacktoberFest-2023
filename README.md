### 3. Create a `calculate the number of vowels and consonants in a String` Script
Add a `Vowel_Consonant.xx` script to the `scripts` directory in any language of your choice! Here is an example:

```Javascript
// LANGUAGE: Javascript
// ENV: Node.js
// AUTHOR: Arjun Thakor
// GITHUB: https://github.com/The-Arjun-Thakor

function countVowelsAndConsonants(str) {
  var vowelCount = 0;
  var consonantCount = 0;
  
  // Convert the string to lowercase to simplify the comparison
  str = str.toLowerCase();

  // Iterate over each character in the string
  for (var i = 0; i < str.length; i++) {
    var char = str[i];
    
    // Check if the character is a letter
    if (/[a-z]/.test(char)) {
      // Check if the character is a vowel
      if (/[aeiou]/.test(char)) {
        vowelCount++;
      } else {
        consonantCount++;
      }
    }
  }
  
  return {
    vowels: vowelCount,
    consonants: consonantCount
  };
}

// Example usage
var string = "Hello World";
var counts = countVowelsAndConsonants(string);

console.log("Number of vowels: " + counts.vowels);
console.log("Number of consonants: " + counts.consonants);

```

Name the file `Vowel_Consonant_yourusername.xx`. e.g., `Vowel_Consonant_arjunthakor.js` or `Vowel_Consonant_arjunthakor.py`.

Add your scripts to the specific folder for specific languages created. 

Don't forget to include the comments as seen above. Feel free to include additional information about the language you choose in your comments too! Like a link to a helpful introduction or tutorial. 

Here is my `Vowel_Consonant` example: [Vowel_Consonant_arjunthakor.js](https://github.com/The-Arjun-Thakor/hacktoberFest-2023/scripts/Vowel_Consonant_arjunthakor.js)
